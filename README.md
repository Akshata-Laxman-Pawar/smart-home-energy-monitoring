This is a web-based Smart Home Energy Monitoring system that tracks energy usage in real time.

# Smart Home Energy Monitoring System

This project is a **Smart Home Energy Monitoring System** that tracks real-time energy consumption using **React.js (Frontend)** and **Node.js with MongoDB (Backend)**.

## Features
- ðŸ“Š **Real-time energy data visualization** using Chart.js.
- ðŸ”„ **Data fetched from a backend API** (Node.js + Express).
- ðŸ›¢ **MongoDB database** to store energy usage data.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Chart.js, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Challenges Faced
Data Sync: Ensuring real-time updates between frontend and backend.
MongoDB Connection: Setting up and debugging database connectivity.
State Management: Handling data efficiently in React.
Future Improvements
âœ… Add user authentication
âœ… Implement real-time WebSocket updates
âœ… Improve UI design with Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
